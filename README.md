## Overview

This repository contains the source code related to the paper:

**_A Centralized Federated Learning Framework with Security Aspects Against Byzantine and Sybil Attacks_**

to be presented at the **ICAISC 2025 (International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing)**.

The proposed framework integrates Multi-Krum client selection with the FoolsGold aggregation approach to defend against two of the most severe threats in federated learning systems: **Byzantine attacks** and **Sybil attacks**. It is designed to enhance business continuity and robustness of distributed learning setups under adversarial conditions.
